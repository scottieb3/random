1
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.240
Product Manager: Everyone just as a preface and recording this just testing out a zoom feature. There's no real reason Jackson happy to turn it off.

2
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.910
Product Manager: Little experiment here.

3
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.870
Product Manager: While we wait for your code and Nestor. I don't know if you saw on Slack, but

4
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.320
Product Manager: We should have a creator license where you today. I'm just waiting for happy to give me the money to pay for it.

5
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.840
Product Manager: Will you be building more in Tableau minutes

6
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.800
Front-End Dev: Sounds good. I didn't have a question. Um, this to workbooks or folders to one development and one customer

7
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.950
Front-End Dev: Which is the one that I'm supposed to be editing.

8
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.100
Back-End Dev: I think for your task.

9
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.450
Back-End Dev: I just published a new version and test publish, you should. Oh wait, I think I have to give you permission for that.

10
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.730
Back-End Dev: So you have to take that as a base to make your changes on

11
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.940
Front-End Dev: The test publish

12
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.620
Back-End Dev: Yeah. Do you see it on

13
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.320
Front-End Dev: Um, no, but I can talk to you offline about it.

14
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.840
Product Manager: Alright.

15
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.950
Product Manager: Let's get this party started. I'm going to do a share screen here.

16
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.760
Product Manager: And we'll start with OKRs, and then

17
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.470
Product Manager: Move right into sales pipeline and product.

18
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.120
Product Manager: So for everyone who was at product council or saw one of my many emails yesterday. Our OKRs,

19
00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:06.750
Product Manager: Pop up here. We're doing pretty well in terms of the pipeline and weekly usage. And of course, there's a number of demos going on right now. So I think we're at six companies by my account that are evaluating

20
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.280
Product Manager: So hopefully will land 280 $6,000 worth of revenue this week.

21
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.980
Product Manager: Sales1 Sales2 SalesLead any, anything you want to update on those demos going on right now are those prospects.

22
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.540
Sales 1: Are those prospects listed here. If so, can you scroll up

23
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:36.840
Product Manager: They're not listed here. But I've actually just started trying to keep track for happy asked me about this every day. So just trying to keep track for myself. Okay.

24
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.370
Sales 1: OK, Prospect1, I should have an update from them this week followed up Friday haven't got a response yet, but I think he was out of office should have an update from those folks this week.

25
00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:11.700
Sales 1: Necessarily waters. We did a pitch with the users decision makers last thurs last Friday and it went well. Overall, they're a little mark your towards engage, but they see the value and insight as well. So hopefully

26
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.660
Sales 1: Making that a package deal and then

27
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.270
Sales 1: That should be that's it on my side. I'm not sure if

28
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.680
Sales Lead: The short answer should be PM that you have the list captured

29
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.050
Sales Lead: Down to I would say the nationally water. Those are all

30
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.190
Sales Lead: Potential to close this quarter.

31
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.080
Oh, cool.

32
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.710
Product Manager: That would be great.

33
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.520
Sales Lead: So 246 of them.

34
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.700
Product Manager: Yeah, I mean, that would get us to 620 right

35
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.450
Sales Lead: Yeah but potential to close this quarter does not mean close this quarter. So I would put Prospect1, probably at the highest likelihood, I would put fusion up there.

36
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:09.630
Sales Lead: I would put Prospect2 up there that like even if it's like a 50% chance to close this quarter. There's always a chance that you lose it. But there's also maybe goes to Q4

37
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.450
Sales Lead: Cool.

38
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.330
Product Manager: Alright, so let's jump into insights projects.

39
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:30.060
Product Manager: So I'm going to minimize inbox and we'll come back to that at the end. But in terms of development, actually, as you know, Client1.

40
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.120
Product Manager: Hang up, bear with me for just a second.

41
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:11.640
Product Manager: Okay, so in terms of projects rebels done so I'm just gonna market complete there's no further work needed on it and it's AM you it's live right everything's been set to

42
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.380
Product Manager: Rebel

43
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.460
Product Manager: Correct any initial feedback problem or any response.

44
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.320
Account Manager: No, but they finally gave me a time to meet with them. So, so when

45
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.420
Product Manager: What's currently going on in development, we've got generic beer and liquor demo. So this should basically be just the go to source.

46
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.500
Product Manager: For sales to basically any brand and these categories should require any custom work after this

47
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:48.870
Product Manager: And then just one's already started working on the two standard store segments. She's got some change size recommendations from her feasibility analysis.

48
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:58.140
Product Manager: And so there's some work going on there and then front-ends jumping in gamely on CCP CPU and so there's some UI updates that he's working down

49
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:08.010
Product Manager: So that's everything we've locked in for committed and we're going to push through. So just kind of pause there if there any questions about any of those three projects.

50
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.590
Back-End Dev: For this segment. Are we doing the state voice also

51
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.410
Product Manager: That's the second one. And I think there's a feasibility ticket. Yeah, you. Is that right,

52
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:33.390
Back-End Dev: Oh yeah, I think we did feasibility on board store chain and state region state so

53
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:40.800
Product Manager: I, yeah, I just didn't see that in JIRA. So yeah, that's great. Any, I guess, any takeaways from what you've seen so far.

54
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.210
Back-End Dev: I think board. The board. They approached us look good to me. I guess it's us other finalists.

55
00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:03.870
Product Manager: Alright, in terms of what's next. A lot of the insights is triage stuff is coming up. And so we've got a quick prototype or a bare bones prototype of the benchmark dashboard.

56
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:15.060
Product Manager: And I can share that out with people. I've been getting some initial feedback from the sales team in Carnegie and I have taken a look to see, like what we think is feasible and easy.

57
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.470
Product Manager: This would be the main landing screen for insights is triage.

58
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:35.430
Product Manager: And then after that we've prioritized the distribution dashboard Dana's got a mock up of that right now. And so she's just doing a quick iteration. And again, I'll put that she encouraged me to talk about how to build that out.

59
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:45.180
Product Manager: And then I've moved up this new one on here distribution leads list and this is as a result of what Prospect1's most especially interested in

60
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:57.720
Product Manager: And so ds's actually knocking that up today. So hopefully we'll have the ability to kind of move all three of these into the next or at least have them ready to be picked up for the next sprint depending on capacity.

61
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:11.730
Product Manager: Anything missing. I'm not going to go through the whole list after that because I think, well, this is kind of will. Will cap out in the next week, but anything

62
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:20.040
Product Manager: SalesLead MarketingLead any anybody wants to raise their hand and say, hey, this should be higher up. Or actually, we don't need that new one.

63
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:39.390
Account Manager: I have one that is kind of pending so if next week we're talking to Client1 and showing them the new report if they are going to continue their contract. How quickly can we spin up the pricing report into a dashboard for them.

64
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.810
Product Manager: Here as new some perfect segue.

65
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:51.840
Product Manager: It.

66
00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:03.330
Product Manager: I'd say, Geez ones built the query behind it. And so it's a matter of getting that into tablo and making it interactive will, in terms of complexity. I'll defer to what card it thinks about it.

67
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:18.540
Back-End Dev: Yeah, I think we might have to do some feasibility to see how how the graph looks like for every product of apple

68
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:28.380
Back-End Dev: Because we do, we chose the best one, and it looked good. So we might have to understand how it probably would look and identify possible anomalies.

69
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:38.580
Back-End Dev: And fix the data side. And once that is ready for all the UPC I guess it's fairly simple to put it on tablo because we have the mark this identity.

70
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:46.710
Product Manager: Yeah, and not just UPC but stores, because it's a manual outlier removals were

71
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.010
Product Manager: Like charging 20 cents and that was clearly wrong.

72
00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:06.570
Product Manager: Yeah, I think it's very doable. AM I like we can keep it in our inbox until we hear back from them. And then if it's like something they're excited about. We can put it at the top of our list. Okay, good.

73
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:14.010
Account Manager: All right, ideally, I want to handle that conversation. Next week is not directly ask them like, hey, are you guys staying like bring up the issue.

74
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:21.930
Account Manager: But if they like the report and don't have very many changes, it would be great to go back to them and say, if you guys like this and we have all systems go like

75
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:33.360
Account Manager: We should be able to get this over to you in the next month or so or like, give them a decent time frame and then come back to them in a few days with like a exact time frame obviously buffering.

76
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:44.940
Account Manager: For us doing all this work, but that way if they're like oh yeah that sounds great mid September is perfect or October like that will give us indication like that they aren't going to be staying with us.

77
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.550
Account Manager: If that makes sense.

78
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:55.410
Product Manager: Yeah, I think the only thing that might Trump it in terms of priority is if Prospect1 signs and we need to get this leads list of them pretty quick.

79
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:02.040
Product Manager: There's like a bare bones version of this leads list is like a CSV report like outside of tablo

80
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:09.390
Product Manager: That SalesLead and I have talked about at least. And so we might want to prioritize that over

81
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.630
Product Manager: The pricing report for Client1, if we're sure that Client1 is going to stay

82
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.290
Yeah.

83
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.010
Product Manager: But I don't think September end of September is unreasonable, even if we had to do both.

84
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:30.540
Account Manager: Okay, I can give them like a loose time and then obviously, I'll confirm with our team on a

85
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.470
Product Manager: Just say like early or so that way they have to stay

86
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.780
Account Manager: Up 2022

87
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:54.270
Account Manager: Says john you also just reminded me of Prospect1. I talked to OpsLead this morning and Prospect3 is going. It sounds like to be getting insights as well. So that will add another build to this, but I do not have the details enough to tell you where it should be slotted

88
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.450
Account Manager: But just something

89
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.160
Account Manager: Yeah, if you keep on your list.

90
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.450
Back-End Dev: So, so should we prioritize

91
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.380
Back-End Dev: Cigarettes category that will demo for this.

92
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:25.080
Account Manager: I did get clarification on that and Prospect3 only has around like 10 products and then they are specifically looking at a couple other competitors and they were going to export something from Nielsen to give to OpsLead. So we would have all the pieces that they would need for their dashboards.

93
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:35.130
Product Manager: But it would be a custom built, we wouldn't be able to, it looks like building it for Prospect3 would unlock it for anyone else necessarily

94
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:49.530
Design: But um if Prospect3 that is going to be live on the enterprise app with engage is going to want insights that would mean that we have to have inside some enterprise app to go live with them for insights. Right.

95
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:56.010
Product Manager: I don't think so. As long as they're fine. Having the enterprise app for engage and then they have to pop open a tab little leg.

96
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.310
Design: Back.

97
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:09.060
Account Manager: Yeah, I don't think that's a great customer experience. But if we spent up insights for them during the pilot, we can

98
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.370
Account Manager: Probably mentioned that

99
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:26.760
Design: If just something to think about in terms of priority, like, in addition to getting them a dashboard ready, we might want to make sure we can put it in the enterprise that I didn't know the timing might lineup but PM just something to think about know

100
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:42.120
Product Manager: We've got the enterprise app pretty far down here in terms of priority and it's blocked, but until we do to migrate to Tableau Server, which is a pretty big asked, so I'm a little wary of kind of pulling these to the front of the list, because it would mean delaying a lot of other

101
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.440
Back-End Dev: So,

102
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.610
Back-End Dev: Yeah, actually.

103
00:17:45.960 --> 00:18:01.590
Back-End Dev: Yeah, I think the tablet server. I'm doing some research to speak and the sprint and probably we can do to report as the first priority to move to have your server and tested on it and yeah, that way we can do an end to end.

104
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:21.600
Back-End Dev: From tablo development till the front end part of insights and advice app for June and see how it works. And then probably we can slowly move everything else like AC DC wonderful to server Tableau Server if if we're proceeding with the insights module.

105
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:36.270
Product Manager: So you're saying we build a tablo dashboards using or sorry, the Prospect3 dashboards using Tableau Server, would they necessarily it's still be in tablo though versus the enterprise app.

106
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.920
Back-End Dev: Know we can we not wait for our new server to set up, we can continue to work on tablet dashboard and push it on tablo online.

107
00:18:44.370 --> 00:19:00.750
Back-End Dev: But when the server is ready. I can ask the first migration, I can migrate over to server so that front end team can integrate a container app for tool so that eventually to have both engage in their insights on the container.

108
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.780
Back-End Dev: But only then it will slowly migrate everything else.

109
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.560
Product Manager: So maybe like our test case of getting this flow right and then we can move everything

110
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.230
Back-End Dev: Yeah. Ideally I would have wanted to do some other one as a test case but

111
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.160
Product Manager: Rebecca, what's the timing on July 30

112
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.880
Design: Me for insight.

113
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.550
Product Manager: Engage whichever one

114
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:40.290
Design: Or engage. I mean, we're starting to hopped in 817 so but they're going to get access October to engage up

115
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.240
Design: So they won't see the enterprise up till October.

116
00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:03.630
Account Manager: Yeah, there's also OpsLead mentioned like they're really easy to work with and someone today had mentioned like they don't need insights for the pilot, potentially, but if they sign the full contract. So there's a lot of up near details that I think are so getting locked down around that.

117
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.030
Product Manager: How much money does insights, get out of this deal down towards or

118
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.720
Account Manager: If you get it built for. So I'll give you all of it.

119
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.120
Design: Kind of sounding like a Q4 thing but

120
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.160
Design: Sure.

121
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.990
Account Manager: Like September 30

122
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:27.300
Product Manager: Yeah.

123
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:40.620
Product Manager: So I'll move this up. Oh, I'll keep it in the inbox, just because it doesn't sound like we have a clear idea and when, how high of a priority. This is or is this like a lock in thing that we need

124
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.070
Product Manager: Oh, check with happier. Yes.

125
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.130
Design: Oh, were you trying to me either. You're trying to AM

126
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.110
Design: AM Oh okay, good.

127
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.270
Design: I don't know. AM heard

128
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.300
Design: She's muted.

129
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.320
Account Manager: Can you guys hear me now.

130
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.310
Account Manager: Yeah, okay. It keeps switching between my laptop and my screen.

131
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:24.120
Account Manager: I think it's a definite thing that's happening. I think the logistics around when they need it are up for debate still

132
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:33.180
Account Manager: And what its gonna look like between like giving them the pilot region versus national if they choose to go national so there's a lot of details in there that need to be sorted out.

133
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:44.730
Product Manager: I'll just drag them under the leads list and keep my fingers crossed for Prospect1 now where we keep that prioritized and then I'll do the same with price monitoring. I think it's a

134
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.880
Product Manager: We can next week. Talk about jumping it up if the feedback from our goals is positive.

135
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.530
Product Manager: So I'm

136
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:04.080
Product Manager: The other one, we're talking about for the inbox. This goes to Sales2 is we kind of have this, this just a placeholder on whether

137
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:15.750
Product Manager: Liquor companies need to see that hyper localized understanding of what what counties and cities, they're allowed to sell it in convenience stores or whether they kind of just ignore it.

138
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.520
Product Manager: I know Prospect4, you're still evaluating so we weren't going to do this until they pay, but any, any feedback from them yet on this.

139
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.520
Sales 2: Nothing yet I meeting with them on Friday. So I'll not more than

140
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.350
Who

141
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.390
Product Manager: There's a couple other things on here that are further out.

142
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.830
Product Manager: They kind of rely on different parts of the product being built for insights history. So I'm just gonna leave them in here for the moment.

143
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.710
Right.

144
00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:07.680
Product Manager: If there's anything that you know anyone from development, all the way through sales to marketing that you guys are want to suggest in here. I'm very much game if you just throw it in the US on a board or just slapping we can keep it as a conversation topic for this meeting.

145
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:15.300
Product Manager: They just put a couple words in the title that make it relevant or understandable and we can move from there.

146
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.410
Product Manager: Anything missing from the list that anyone wants to bring up right up

147
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.860
Product Manager: I'm especially thinking of Client2 and fusion.

148
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:37.350
Account Manager: ClientRep did send over additional pieces for Client2.

149
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.180
Account Manager: One is a hierarchy thing with since they have three

150
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:50.580
Account Manager: But at first pass both look larger than adding them into this sprint that's currently going

151
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.800
Product Manager: Me like a product hierarchy.

152
00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:04.320
Account Manager: Know their geography hierarchy, they technically have three, but when we built the dashboards, we were working with Great Lakes only who only has two

153
00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:17.490
Account Manager: So they right now have sales district and sales office, but they actually have a region and then ClientRep was looking to get a roll up view of how United is doing as a whole. So combining all the regions all together.

154
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:31.740
Account Manager: And sales offices and then he did send us over his product classification of what brands and manufacturers, they look at it in each category, which I think that's a lot more of scope work and probably additional conversations with ClientRep.

155
00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.860
Account Manager: Before we'd put it on the roadmap.

156
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.360
Product Manager: Okay.

157
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.890
Product Manager: I'll keep the ghire paraphrasing here, but it doesn't sound like we're committing to

158
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.360
Account Manager: Know, the only thing I committed to is fixing the issue that's currently going on.

159
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.420
Product Manager: In science,

160
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:55.590
Back-End Dev: In the to KC region division and sales office. What is the purpose hierarchy.

161
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.220
Account Manager: Wait, say that again region.

162
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.640
Back-End Dev: I see sales office then division then region.

163
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:16.740
Account Manager: Oh divisions are called a district. Yeah, so they use in their current dashboards. They use division and sales office, but they actually have one higher which is called their region or yeah the region and they have three of those.

164
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:26.130
Account Manager: To East West and Central. So ClientRep is looking to get that to get the divisions rolled up to a region view.

165
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:41.460
Account Manager: And then the region view rolled up even higher into just how is united as a whole, doing like their share swing across the entire every single office versus like Prospect2 in the same region are saying their whole territory.

166
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.720
Product Manager: All right. Anything else last chance for the week.

167
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.850
Back-End Dev: I had one more questions about the Prospect5 can we use the bag of dashboard for Prospect5 demo.

168
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:21.000
Product Manager: So the way this is structured, I think, Sales2, correct me if I'm wrong. We need to get 30 new PCs loaded. So currently, their new PCs just existing UPC raw. So we'd have to support them over.

169
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:31.710
Product Manager: I don't think like, I think we could clean them and put them into master Deaton but their thing is our custom regions don't really work right now. And so they need to see the states.

170
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.190
Sales Lead: Well, they just don't sell product and their regions of the demo.

171
00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:35.820
Right.

172
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.620
Product Manager: Anything else I'm missing on that. Sales2 any other changes liquid nice would need to see

173
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:59.370
Sales 2: Now that's about it. We're SalesLead. I talked to them last week. So we're kind of waiting for them to follow up on their next steps. And then we'll let you guys know like what that turn around a little look like

174
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:15.270
Back-End Dev: So once we roll out the store segment change into the pack though dashboard, we the dashboard can be used for liquid liquid is right, because by the time master budget and also different with the new PCs.

175
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.980
Product Manager: We just need to push over the new PCs. It'd be a pretty small change though. Yeah.

176
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:42.600
Sales 2: It's a good question. I just thought of PM and Back-End I noticed in the Prospect6 dashboard that their share swing view has the store count on it by segment by territory, but it is just on that view. I wanted. Is that something that

177
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:49.020
Sales 2: Will be standard or will be on all dashboards. I haven't seen on on any other ones yet.

178
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.750
Product Manager: We can make it standard. I think it's probably just a mistake.

179
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.190
Sales 2: Okay.

180
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.990
Product Manager: You want it removed.

181
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.130
Sales 2: No, I just wanted some consistency. Because when you order item rank, it's not there.

182
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:09.540
Sales 2: It's not a pressing issue. I just noticed it on one dashboard of all the ones I've looked at

183
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:19.620
Product Manager: Here your cardiac any concerns. If we were to show store count in a demo on each geo region like should we do that standard or should we not

184
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.080
Account Manager: Unlike the scoop most coverage, man.

185
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:25.800
Yeah.

186
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:27.840
Account Manager: Don't we already do that.

187
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.990
Product Manager: I started to be on like item rank and share screen.

188
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.180
Account Manager: Oh, like when they drop it down.

189
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.730
Account Manager: I don't see any issues with that we can take the functionality that we just pushed in Client1s and copy that over

190
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.780
Product Manager: Oh yeah we're good.

191
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:51.780
Account Manager: formatting is a pain in the ass and tablo you didn't give you any lines to make sure things are

192
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.430
Account Manager: lined up properly.

193
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.390
Product Manager: three rounds of do it right.

194
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:03.060
Account Manager: You can't copy and paste from tab to tabs. You have to re eyeball at every time.

195
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:12.060
Back-End Dev: I think, for this we can copy the format of the map and sharp spring to it. I think it's doable. That's fine. Yeah.

196
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:17.130
Product Manager: Maybe we just increase the scope for the standard store segments to include

197
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.170
Yeah.

198
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.420
Back-End Dev: For this I noticed there are

199
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:47.400
Back-End Dev: That start with the statewide. At least I noticed there are some states where we have only 10 stores. So when you're actually going that granular you might see a huge variance, like some states can show show 1020 and some will show like 800 and they all might come in the same region.

200
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:50.850
Back-End Dev: Yeah.

201
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.170
Product Manager: sales guys you're okay with that. Right. I think we've talked about this, but just confirming

202
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.810
Back-End Dev: Yeah, if you're showing numbers.

203
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.010
Back-End Dev: That they

204
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.170
Back-End Dev: Just want to get your feedback.

205
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.830
Sales 2: I mean, there's one territory in the demo with one store in it.

206
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.980
Sales 2: We've already been doing that.

207
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:30.900
Product Manager: SalesLead, you're really quiet, you're not asking for anything. You're not cutting anything. Are we doing everything right. Are we doing everything wrong.

208
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.660
Sales Lead: Well, I would say if you're ever on one extreme, that's about

209
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.070
Product Manager: Right. Any last chance for real this that any any new projects any new requests from clients.

210
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.100
Sales Lead: No, but by next week, we may have something for you. Really to diffusion

211
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:00.570
Product Manager: Tool.

212
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:08.820
Product Manager: Okay, so the two main changes or that I'm gonna keep my ear out for in the next week is this Prospect1's

213
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:22.560
Product Manager: will drive. How much of a priority deletes list is and how fast we need to get it alive and Client1 will do the same for the product price monitoring. So both of those could jump up if either company comes back as strongly enthusiastic.

214
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:30.420
Product Manager: And then AM all sync with happy just on the timing for the Prospect3 dashboard and whether it has to be an enterprise app.

215
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.520
Product Manager: Cool.

216
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.910
Product Manager: All right, thanks everyone.

217
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:40.260
Thank you.
